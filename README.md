## Sports Analytics: Uncovering Insights Through Data

### Description
This repository is a collection of projects and experiments where I practice and learn data visualization using R and Python. I explore NBA stats and play-by-play data from [here](https://github.com/shufinskiy/nba_data) to create visualizations, inclusing shot charts, heatmaps and other anlytical graphics. The goal is to develope a deeper understanding of data story telling and sports analytics.
