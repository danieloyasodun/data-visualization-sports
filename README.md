## Sports Analytics: Uncovering Insights Through Data

### Description
This repository is a collection of projects and experiments where I practice and learn data visualization using R and Python. I explore NBA stats and play-by-play data from [here](https://github.com/shufinskiy/nba_data) to create visualizations, inclusing shot charts, heatmaps and other anlytical graphics. The goal is to develope a deeper understanding of data story telling and sports analytics.

### Frameworks and Languages Used
 - **Programming Languages**: R, Python
 - **Libraries/Frameworks**: YOLO, OpenCV, K-means, Optical Flow, Perspective Transformation


### Hotspot Chart
[`hotspot`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/nba-data-visualization/blob/main/hotspotchart/hotspot.R)

The charts show the areas of the court where the player prefers (and dislikes) to shoot from. It visualizes their shooting tendencies relative to league average. The darker and denser the red area the more frequently the players from that location. The gray areas represent spots where the player shoots less often than their peers, areas with no color indicate locations where player's shot selection aligns with the league average.

### Computer Vision Football Analysis
[`football_analysis`](https://github.com/danieloyasodun/football_analysis)

This project aims to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in video using YOLO, a top AI object detection model, and improve its performance through training. Using K-means clustering to assign players to teams based on shirt colors, calculate ball possession percentage and track player movement with optical flow. Perspective transformation will convert movement from pixels to meters. Finally, weâ€™ll calculate player speed and distance covered, addressing real-world challenges suitable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.
